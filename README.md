# 🚌 **BusNet360 – Distributed Urban Bus Network Analysis (Apache Spark + NetworkX)**

BusNet360 is a **distributed bus network analysis system** built using **Apache Spark**, designed for scalable processing of urban transportation networks.
This project analyzes **20+ bus stops** and **56 directional routes**, identifies **transport hubs**, detects **isolated stops**, uncovers **connectivity gaps**, and visualizes the complete network through **advanced graph analytics**.


It combines:

* **Apache Spark (PySpark)** → Distributed processing
* **NetworkX** → Graph construction
* **Matplotlib** → Visual analytics
* **Pandas** → Data transformation

## 🚀 **Project Features**

### ✔ Distributed Bus Network Analysis

Performs large-scale computation on bus routes, connectivity degrees, route density, and stop accessibility.

### ✔ Directed Graph Construction

Builds a fully directed transport graph with edge attributes such as travel time and bus number.

### ✔ Connectivity & Accessibility Ranking

Identifies:

* Main hub
* Least accessible stops
* Low/medium/high connectivity zones

### ✔ Route Analytics

Computes:

* Longest & shortest routes
* Bus frequencies
* Network density
* Travel time statistics

### ✔ Fully Generated Visualizations

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas networkx matplotlib
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Script

```bash
python bus_network_analysis_spark.py
```

### 3️⃣ Outputs Generated

After execution, the following images will be saved:

```

# 🧩 **How It Works**

### **1. Load Bus Network Data**

Spark loads bus stop and route CSV files from the `bus_network_data/` folder.

### **2. Build Directed Graph**

Each stop becomes a **node**
Each bus route becomes a **directed edge** with attributes:

* Travel time
* Bus number

### **3. Compute Connectivity Using Spark**

Spark computes:

* outgoing routes
* incoming routes
* total degree
* accessibility class

### **4. Identify Transport Hubs**

The system detects:

* **Main Hub** (highest degree)
* **Top 5 hubs**
* **Isolated stops (0–2 connections)**

### **5. Route Analytics**

Includes:

* Longest 3 routes
* Shortest 3 routes
* Bus frequency per route
* Network density calculation

### **6. Visualization**

Two major graphs:

* **Network connectivity map**
* **Connectivity ranking chart**

Both saved automatically.
